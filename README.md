# PDF Toolkit — Vite + WASM (100% client-side)
## Fully generated by AI (GTP 5.2)

This is a **pure browser** version of the app: **no server, no upload**.
Heavy work runs in a **Web Worker**.

## Features (MVP)
- Merge PDFs (pdf-lib)
- Split pages (output as single PDF or ZIP con un PDF por rango/página; usa `1,3,5-7; 10-12`)
- Compress PDF (qpdf compiled to WASM; "decent" compression/rewriting)
- PDF -> Image (MuPDF WASM; all pages to PNG/JPG inside a ZIP)

## Install / Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- Compression is not Ghostscript-level. It's a rewrite with stream compression/object streams via qpdf-wasm.
- PDF->Images uses MuPDF.js from npm (WASM, ESM-only), and a tiny in-worker ZIP packer (store mode, no external deps). Split reuses the same ZIP helper when eliges ZIP, separando rangos con `;`.

## Security headers for multithreaded WASM (optional)
If you later enable WASM threads / SharedArrayBuffer, you'll need COOP/COEP headers.
This MVP doesn't support them yet

## GitHub Pages deployment
A workflow is included at `.github/workflows/pages.yml` that builds and deploys the app to **GitHub Pages** on pushes to `main`.

After pushing to GitHub:
1. Go to **Settings → Pages**
2. Set **Build and deployment** to **GitHub Actions**
3. The site will be published at: `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`

(We set `BASE_PATH=/<repo>/` during the build so Vite assets resolve correctly on Pages.)
